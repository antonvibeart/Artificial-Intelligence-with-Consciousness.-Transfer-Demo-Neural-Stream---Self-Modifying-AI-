# Artificial-Intelligence-with-Consciousness.-Transfer-Demo-Neural-Stream---Self-Modifying-AI-
A small, thread-safe Python demo that **streams simulated brain signals** into a **self-modifying AI**.   It showcases: buffered real-time ingestion, Hebbian weight updates with weight decay, a decaying “consciousness matrix,” qualia memory, self-reflection metrics, and clean startup/shutdown.
